# @dizmo/generator-module

> Generator for [Node.js] JavaScript, TypeScript and CoffeeScript modules

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js] v10.15.3 LTS (or higher); for Linux distribution based packages (`deb` or `rpm`) see also [binary distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).

## Install

```sh
npm install -g yo
```

```sh
npm install -g @dizmo/generator-module
```

**Note:** On most operating systems the `-g` option (shortcut for `--global`) requires super user (administrator) rights. Due to security considerations however, avoid using such a privileged account and see the [FAQ](#i-cannot-install-yo-globally-with-npm-install--g) section to be able to install global packages as a *regular* user.

## FAQ

### I cannot install `yo` globally with `npm install -g`?

You have to set up `npm` for global installations, since `yo` should neither be installed nor run with `sudo`. The preferred approach here is to enable `npm` to install packages globally *without* breaking out of the `$HOME` folder, by setting a local `node` `prefix`. This is achieved for example by running:

```sh
echo 'prefix = ~/.node' >> ~/.npmrc
```

in your local shell. After that the `$PATH` environment variable needs to be modified, to point to the new installation destination for the global `node` executables, by adjusting your favorite shell's configuration &ndash; for example use:

```sh
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.node/bin"
```

in your `~/.bashrc`. After that, you can happily run `npm install -g yo` without `sudo` and without running into potential permission conflicts. Further, later-on if something gets completely broken and you want to start from scratch, all you need to do, is to remove your `~/.node` directory.

### Security Audits

The [npm] tool offers the `npm audit` and `npm audit fix` commands, which scan your project for vulnerabilities and automatically install any compatible updates to vulnerable dependencies. Run `npm help audit` to get an in-depth description about this tool.
